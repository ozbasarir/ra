            | I can&apos;t tell you how much we enjoyed our visit to San Francisco, and what made it so enjoyable was staying in your flat versus a hotel. My family just loved it. We will be contacting you again for future stays. Having a parking spot was a real plus.

            | We had a perfect stay in San Francisco with our family of five, including three teenagers. The apartment is very centrally located with a lot of restaurants and bars nearby. It&apos;s a beautiful property and is well maintained and clean. We especially appreciated the parking space and the washer dryer - we did not use our car at all while in San Francisco; the bus system is convenient and easy to navigate. The owner, Peggy, was very helpful and prompt in answering questions. We visited all the usual San Francisco attractions, but we especially enjoyed the museum and the Academy of Sciences - an amazing place for kids, teens, and adults.

            | The house was simply perfect. Excellent location. Only one block away from the famous Painted Ladies yet on a very quiet street. Very close to great cafes and restaurants. We felt like we were living in San Francisco like locals. There was an Apple computer for us to use and Wifi. The kitchen is well equipped and the bathroom is simply lovely. We already have recommended it. They seem to book pretty fast so be aware, it is popular!

            | We really enjoyed our stay at this flat. Everything about it exceeded our expectations. The location was second to none - Divisidero, Alamo Park, and Hayes Valley were close-by and great hangouts for us. The abundance of space in the flat was perfect for our group of five. The excellent condition and charming character of the flat made our stay in San Francisco so special. We were all very comfortable. We are so happy that we found this flat to rent. It would definitely be our first choice for accommodation on our next trip to San Francisco. Renting from the owner was a very smooth and positive process.

            | I can&apos;t say enough about this rental. The apartment itself was beautiful. Very spacious and clean. We were traveling with 5 adults and a one year old and we all had plenty of space. There is a small office (which worked well as a nursery with our pack n play), a living room, three bedrooms, a huge kitchen and attached dining room. The rooms were very comfortable. I wanted to take the bed home with me! The kitchen was amazing! Giant skylight and well stocked with dishes. The house is located right by Divisadero and McAllister which means that the 5 Fulton bus runs right by it. This particular bus is the best because it can take you to the beach or downtown. Peggy was easy to get a hold of and answered question quickly. Another nice thing about this apartment is that it is child friendly. There was a pack n play there as well as a high chair, games, a sippy cup, etc. It was wonderful! I would stay there again in a heartbeat!

            | The flat was spacious, clean, and had everything we needed for all of us (kids, parents, grandparents). Since we&apos;ve lived in San Francisco previously, we picked Alamo Square to stay in for its location (residential and close to everything). We all felt at home here and could&apos;t have asked for anything more. The kitchen and bathrooms were elegantly updated with modern features while the integrity of the Victorian style flat was maintained throughout. This is a true San Francisco experience.

            | My family came to visit from Chicago and I found this apartment for them. It was perfect. The 3 bedrooms were so big and spacious and the kitchen and bathrooms were as amazing as they look in the photos and it was super clean. My family really enjoyed staying here and they could not stop talking about how nice the apartment was. Peggy was really nice and accomodating too. She was there to greet us when we arrived. The neighborhood the apartment is in is also ideal. Central to everything, easy to get around to other neighborhoods as many of the buslines are less than a block away and delicious restaurants. The fact that parking is available too is key if you have a rental car. Also, my security deposit was returned right away which I appreciate! I would give this apt 10 stars if I could. Happy Traveling!

The property is very well organized, stocked with everything needed, and well maintained. We chose this flat again partly for the location, as we love to walk everywhere, and we certainly did that! It is also on the bus line so very easy to take the bus. Staying in the apartment helped to make us feel part of this lovely neighbourhood, and everything we needed was nearby. Thank you Peggy and Oz

We already started planning when we want to go back.

            | I come to SF a couple of times a year for business and I always arrange to stay a couple of days extra to enjoy the city. I must say that this apartment is among the very best I have stayed at in this city. First of all, the place itself is very nicely furnished with everything you can ask for, including many guidebooks to organize activities during your stay. The street is quiet but very well located, within a block of Alamo Square and walking distance to many restaurants and grocery stores. If you are here for tourism, many neighborhoods are less than 30mn walking distance or a couple of minutes by cab/bus. I had to attend business in the CBD for several days and again it took no more than 30 mn to walk there. For the days I was in a hurry, I hired a cab which took less than 10 mn to get me to the office. Last but not least, this is a fantastic value. The price for such a large apartment in such a good location is hard to beat. Before finding this flat, I was used paying up to twice the price for a smaller place and much further away from downtown. No need to say I will be back!

            | Being former natives, whose families live in SF, staying in such a great apartment over the summer made us feel right at home and wanting to move back! The apartment was perfect: spacious, amazing kitchen, perfectly equipped and well located. It was wonderful to receive a bottle of wine on arrival. We highly recommend the place!

            | My family and I rented this apartment for 5 days during our California vacation. We were very happy with the apartment and owner. Highly recommended for a family of up to 6 (comfortably). The apartment was clean and very well furnished, and felt like home rather than a hotel. The place is conveniently located in a nice, quiet neighbourhood just minutes walk from Alamo Square park and only 15 minutes drive to downtown. We had a minivan and Peggy kindly let us park in their driveway during our stay. Be sure to ask beforehand because on-street parking is at a premium especially overnight in San Fransisco!

            | The owners take amazing pridfe making you feel at home in their vacation flat. It is immaculate, and has everything you will need in terms of accessories and comfort features. The location is proximal to evrything. Alamo Square is a block away, it&apos;s on the bus line. Golden Gate Park is jogging distance, nightlife awaits two blocks away on the Divisidero. Our party of five, include my wife, me, our children, and my mother in law. Everyone was pleased. I would highly rate this flat.
